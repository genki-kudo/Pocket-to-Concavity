# Pocket to Concavity (P2C)
![å›³1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96423408/180365403-939d72f2-3268-4398-8ec7-b33bd0732c14.png)

**P2C is a tool for refinement of Protein-Ligand binding site shape from Fpocket.**  
There are two main modes, **Ligand-Free(LF) mode** and **Ligand-Bound(LB) mode**. LF mode provides the shape of the deep and druggable concavity where the core scaffold can bind. LB mode searches deep concavity around the bound ligand.

## Requirements
* **Fpocket2**  
  You can install fpocket2 in the following URL.
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/fpocket/files/latest/download
  (If you try to install fpocket in new linux distributions, you can have an error during ```make```. In that case, change ```$(LINKER) $(LFLAGS) $^ -o $@``` the makefile to ```$(LINKER) $^ -o $@ $(LFLAGS)```. More detail of the error is referred in https://sourceforge.net/p/fpocket/mailman/message/28785185/.)  
  
  set PATH in this fpocket directory.  
  ~~~
  $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/fpocket/directory
  ~~~
 
* **Python**  
  We tested P2C on python3.7.10  
  Several modules are needed in addition to default modules.
  * numpy(1.21.2)
  * pandas(2.8.2)
  * sklearn(1.0.2)
  * scipy(1.7.0)
  * pymol(2.5.2)

## Installation
Download this source code from Github, and set PATH in this directory.  
~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/genki-kudo/Pocket-to-Concavity  
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/source/directory
~~~

## Preparation of input files
* **Ligand-Free(LF) mode**  
  In the LF mode of P2C, **protein 3D structure file (PDB format)** need to be prepared. If the PDB file contains substrates such as DNA, RNA, ligands, etc., I recommend removing them so that fpocket can work properly.
  
* **Ligand-Bound(LB) mode**  
  In the LB mode of P2C, **protein 3D structure file (PDB format)** needs to be prepared, as in LF mode. In addition, a **ligand 3D structure file (PDB format)** is required. the ligand file is used to obtain coordinate information during pocket selection and empty sites identification stages; therefore, prepare the file that contains coordinates in the protein-bound state.

## Running
To view options of P2C:
~~~
$ p2c -h
usage: p2c [-h] -m METHOD -p PROTEIN [-l LIGAND] [-d DISTANCE] [-r RANK]
           [-c CLUSTERING] [-t THRESHOLD] [-o LOGFILENAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m METHOD, --method METHOD
                        select mode (LF, LB)
  -p PROTEIN, --protein PROTEIN
                        specify protein file (format:PDB)
  -l LIGAND, --ligand LIGAND
                        specify ligand file (format:PDB). Use this argument
                        only when you select "LB" mode.
  -d DISTANCE, --distance DISTANCE
                        specify the distance of included pocket. Use this
                        argument only when you select "LB" mode.
  -r RANK, --rank RANK  specify the druggability rank of included pocket
                        predicted. Use this argument only when you select "LF"
                        mode.
  -c CLUSTERING, --clustering CLUSTERING
                        default clustering is single-linkage
                        clustering(threshold 4.5A). You can select clustering
                        methods; single-linkage, DBSCAN. (Other clustering
                        methods will be available.) Use this argument only
                        when you select "LB" mode.
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        specify threshold of clustering. (order is 1^-10m)
                        default threshold of single-linkage is 4.5A and that
                        of DBSCAN is 2.0A.
  -o LOGFILENAME, --logfilename LOGFILENAME
                        specify logfile name (default:p2c.log)
~~~

### **example of LF mode**
~~~
$ p2c -m LF -p protein.pdb -r 1
~~~

### **example of LB mode**
~~~
$ p2c -m LB -p protein.pdb -l ligand.pdb -d 5.0
~~~

## Output files
All output files are stored in ```fpoc_output/``` and ```p2c_output/```.  
```fpoc_output``` contains the results of fpocket calculation.  
```p2c_output``` contains the files as follows.  
* **default_pocket.pqr**: alpha-spheres of selected pocket in pocket selection (before elimination process)
* **newshape_pocket.pqr**: alpha-spheres after elimination process
* **visual_lf.pse**: PYMOL session file of LF mode results
* **p2c.log**: log file

In LB mode, additional output files are stored in this directory.  
* **lig_lat.pdb**: lattice representation of the ligand
* **poc_lat.pdb**: lattice representation of the newshape_pocket
* **poc_surp.pdb**: lattice of "(poc_lat.pdb)-(lig_lat.pdb)"
* **poc_next.pqr**: alpha-spheres that did not overlap with the ligand
* **cluster/**: clustering results of "poc_next.pqr"
* **visual_lb.pse**: pymol session file of LB mode results
